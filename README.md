## Overview

In this script, we first define the Kafka configuration properties, including the bootstrap servers, group ID, and auto offset reset.

We then define the Kafka topics for the input and output data streams.

Next, we define the Kafka producer and consumer objects, which are used to send and receive messages to and from the Kafka topics.

We then process the incoming messages from the input topic by performing real-time processing on the data. In this example, we simply add a timestamp to the processed data. We then send the processed data to the output topic using the Kafka producer.

This script can be run on a server to implement a real-time data streaming system that processes large volumes of data in near-real-time, enabling real-time analytics and decision-making.
